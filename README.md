üîó **[https://www.ygeometric.com](https://ygeometric.vercel.app)**

## üéÆ Features

- Calculate probability of drawing specific cards/combinations
- Support for multiple card scenarios
- Mobile-friendly interface

## üì± Usage

1. Enter your deck size (40-60 cards)
2. Set your opening hand size (typically 5-6 cards)
3. Add card groups you want to calculate probabilities where:
   - Amt is the number of copies in your deck
   - Min is the minimum number of copies you want to see in your hand
   - Max is the maximum number of copies you want to see in your hand
4. View real-time probability calculations

## üíª Local Development

# Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nedhmn/ygeometric.git
```

# Navigate to the project

```bash
cd ygeometric
```

# Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

# Start development server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts to add and remove card groups
- [ ] Better error handling
- [ ] Share results with link
- [ ] More documentation on usage

## üßÆ How It Works

The calculator uses the hypergeometric distribution to compute probabilities. This statistical model is perfect for card games as it calculates the probability of drawing specific cards from a finite deck without replacement.
